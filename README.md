# Zero Hunger Network

Zero Hunger Network is a food rescue platform dedicated to reducing food waste and fighting hunger. The platform connects individuals and businesses who have surplus food with those in need, facilitating donations and making it easier for people to find food in their area. Using predictive AI, Zero Hunger Network identifies areas where food demand is highest and directs resources accordingly, ensuring that food is distributed to locations where it can make the most impact. By leveraging technology, our platform creates a smarter, more efficient network to address hunger at a local and community level.

## Tech Stack:
Languages: HTML, CSS, JS, Python
Tools: Firebase, gSpread, Prophet

## How It Works:
Zero Hunger Network is a website made from scratch (vanilla HTML, CSS, JS) that is hosted through Google Firebase. The website serves as an informational page about food donations near the user. The website uses gSpread as a simple database to store food donations and distributions. Then, the back-end analyzes the data and uses predictive modeling to anticipate where and when food needs to be donated. This way, donors can get food to locations that need it most, and people who need food can find it quickly.
